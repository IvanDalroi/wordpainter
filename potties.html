    <center>The Hitler Potties<br>
by<br>
 Gary Neal</center> 
<p>A secret hoard of Nazi porcelain has been discovered in an hitherto, hidden, 
underground warehouse in Hamburg. It was uncovered during excavation work to lay the 
foundations for a new municipal sewage works. The collection consists almost entirely 
of chamber pots and is believed to be Hitler's personal collection. Hitler had an 
obsession with his bowels and was petrified that he would be caught short and have 
nothing to go on and stocked up on chamber pots in every town and city he visited.
Wherever he stayed he had chamber pots in every room. His obsession was such that 
he had the helmets of the German Army modelled on the shape of a chamber pot. 
Indeed in an emergency, many a German helmet held the contents of the Fuhrers bowels, 
giving rise to the phrase, “all Germans are shitheads” and the name jerry as a slang 
term for toilet.
<p>Hitler suffered from severe flatulence and this may have compounded his compulsion 
to be near a chamber pot, giving the unpredictability of a wet fart. Whilst these 
would normally be 'silent but deadly', he lived in constant fear of that awful sticky 
feeling of a full blown follow through and constantly urged Eva to make sure he had 
plenty of clean underwear. He did have some favourite pots and sometimes couldn't
make up his mind which one to use and would hover at the last minute usually leaving 
him caught between two stools.
<p>Social archeologists became excited with the find, when some of the pots were revealed 
to contain what looked like remarkably well preserved, organic matter.
<p>“We can now maybe see what sort of diet Hitler had. He was reputed to be a vegetarian. 
Maybe now we can prove it and see exactly what his diet consisted of.”
<p>A spokesman for Antiquitaten Informationgruppe, the German version of the Antiques Roadshow 
says, 
<p>“If this is genuine Nazi memorabilia, then it should fetch a good price. 
Old porcelain will always hold its value. If the potties can definitely be tied to Hitler, 
then the price could go up like shit off a shovel.
