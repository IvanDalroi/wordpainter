Henry was a successful politician.  Shinned up the greasy pole to become a leading a cabinet minister.  
Then catastrophe struck. The opposition won a landslide victory and Henry's performance was 
so poor that he was delisted.  
<p>Now he barely survives on one directorship.  
He needs your help.
<p>If you can find it in your heart to sponsor Henry for a minimum of 1000 pound per week you will earn 
his eternal gratitude. 
<p>Sponsor an MP today you know it makes sense
