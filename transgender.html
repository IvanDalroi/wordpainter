<center>Transgender</p>
A sexual minefield</center>

<p>When God created Adam and Eve did he (or she, for that matter) ever consider we would run out of ribs. 
Transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid, inter-gender, intersex, pangender. The list can be endless. 
From the outside, it can be confusing. Sex discrimination law makers are confused.</p> 
The UK's sex discrimination laws cover male, female and transgender. These are what they call protected characteristics. 
<p>The transgender characteristic is interpreted as someone who is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process 
(or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person's sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex. 
It does not cover non-binary, gender-fluid or any of the many different gender definitions. 
Confusing for us on the outside, but, what is it like on the inside?</p> 
<p>A 22 year-old transgender Filipino girl has told me. We have been in regular video chat for approximately 12 months, 
so I have got to know her quite well. This is her story.</p> 
<p>We'll call her Georgina (not her real name). She was born George (again, not her real name) and assigned the male gender at birth. 
It was when she was 8 or 9 that she found an unusual attraction towards a male teacher in her primary school. 
At that age sexual feelings are not generally, properly developed, but these feelings persisted over the following years. 
She started to prefer wearing dresses and skirts and attracted to feminine pursuits. Both her parents were concerned at the time, 
but maybe brushing it aside as growing up.</p> 
<p>The Philippines is one of the most LBGTQ-friendly countries in Asia, surprising as it is a predominantly Roman Catholic country. 
This however conflicts with the government's views which up to now refuses to include the LBGTQ community 
in it's anti-discrimination laws. Whether the incoming administration is more enlightened, we will have to wait and see.</p>
Georgina believes her father took her potential transitioning difficult to accept. 
She had already confessed to being a member of the LGBTQ community. Shortly after, her father left the family home. 
She has two step siblings whose father had died. At the age of 17, Georgina finally came out as a transgender woman. 
She started hormone treatment to help develop her breasts, although the hormones do frequently cause mood swings. 
These are not helped by her frequent sadness at being rejected by her father. 
(He has since developed a new relationship and started a new family).</p>
During her initial transitioning period at 17, her school friends were very supportive of her, 
although her teachers were more unsure how to deal with her (bearing in mind this is five years ago).
 Her family have now accepted her new status, especially her mother, for which she is extremely grateful.</p> 
Close physical, personal relationships are problematic at the moment. 
She suffered a serious sexual assault when she was younger and the trauma still lives with her. 
She is still attracted to men although attempts to strike up friendships with men usually falter when they discover she is transgender.</p> 
She takes each day as it comes and is currently studying at the local college for a qualification in Business Administration 
and works in a call centre to help pay the fees. She regularly sends money home to her mother, 
which is quite normal for Filipinos in work, they are very family orientated. 
The Philippines is still relatively poor and it will be interesting to see if the new president, Bong Bong Marcos can make a difference.</p>
Georgina is unsure about her future, but would like to work abroad, where she believes the prospects are better. 
My guess is that wherever she decides to work will depend largely on their attitude to alternative genders. 
Suspicion and fear are the usual responses. I can understand natural born women needing safe spaces. 
There have been reports of women being sexually assaulted in prison by transgender women. 
Athletics is now coming under the spotlight with women's records being shattered by trans women. 
How far do you take sexual equality? Do we need a third category to encompass all alternative genders?</p>
All Georgina wants to do is live as normal life as possible as a woman, which I suggest is true of most transgenders. 
So, does society become more accepting, or must alternative genders live forever in the shadows?
